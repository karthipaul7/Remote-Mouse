# Sample Bluetooth data transfer from mobile to PC
This is a Kotlin-based project that enables users to control their computer mouse using an Android smartphone over Bluetooth BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). To make this functionality work, users must download and install a companion Windows application developed using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). This WPF software acts as a receiver that processes the data sent from the mobile device via Bluetooth BLE and translates it into mouse actions on the computer.

The Android app communicates with the WPF software, sending commands such as cursor movement or mouse clicks, which the WPF application interprets and applies to the connected computer. The system ensures seamless interaction between the smartphone and the computer, providing an intuitive and efficient remote mouse control experience.

This project offers an innovative solution for remote control of computer systems, ideal for presentations, entertainment, or other scenarios where hands-free operation is required.
