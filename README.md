# Sample Bluetooth data transfer from mobile to PC
This is a Kotlin-based project that enables users to data computer using an Android smartphone over Bluetooth BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). To make this functionality work, users must download and install a companion Windows application developed using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). This WPF software acts as a receiver that processes the data sent from the mobile device via Bluetooth BLE and translates it into mouse actions on the computer.
